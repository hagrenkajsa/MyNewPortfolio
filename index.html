              When concluding my studies, I completed my master’s thesis in

              The focus of my research was to develop a tangible concept for a
              holistic security system that enhances security for truck drivers
              in relation to cargo and fuel theft on the road. The project
              followed the Design Thinking methodology in order to understand
              user needs and from that, design an add-on service that creates
              value for all stakeholders, including the driver, fleet owners and
              Volvo Group.

            <p>
              During my studies, I went on an exchange semester in South Korea,
              where I combined my major with exploring Korean food, culture and
              nature. I met many interesting people from all over the world and
              have learned a lot about them and their cultures, something I
              believe will be useful in my future work.

            <h3>UX & UI Design</h3>
            <p>
              One of my strongest skills and passions lies in UX design, where I
              find it fascinating to research user behavior, perception and
              problems and to explore how to meet their needs with solutions
              that are both aesthetic and functional. I strive to create
              experiences that go beyond expectations. I have a keen eye for
              shape, color, and content hierarchy, and I always keep the user’s
              perspective at the forefront of my design process. <br />
              <br />
              My greatest strength is my creativity. I love exploring new
              approaches to design, blending innovative ideas with established
              design principles and always a strong focus on accessibility.

            <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to UX design, I have a strong interest in front-end
              development. Most of my experience is in implementing mobile
              applications using React Native with JavaScript, as well as
              developing web applications with React. My solid CSS skills allow
              me to experiment with colors, shapes and UI structure, which is my
              favorite part of the front-end development! <br />
              <br />
              Through my education, I’ve also gained foundational knowledge in
              back-end development. While back-end isn't my primary focus, this
              background gives me valuable insight into what's possible when
              designing for users, providing a fuller perspective that I find
              beneficial when working on various projects.
